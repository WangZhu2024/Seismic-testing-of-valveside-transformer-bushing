These data are available for the Journal paper “Seismic testing and fracture of obliquely installed valve-side GFRP composite bushing of converter transformer”.

It contains all figures used in the paper, and matlab scripts for phase space reconstructions and discrete wavelet transform.

Note: 
The figure folder was tentatively removed on March 11th for safety. It will be uploaded again once the paper is published.
